This is a machine learning algorithm (Neural network) that uses classifier method. 
We will try to predict  market direction either  “Up” or “Down”.
We are using the neuralnet package in r
Steps used are:
1. Pulling data of 4 indices from yahoo finace using quantmod package
2. clean the data and preprocess it.
3. We add techincal indicators to the data.
4. We extract features for our machine learning algorithm
5. we divide our data into three prts, training validating and testing
6. We fit our data to the neural network model with the training data
7. We validate our model with validating data and optimise our model.
8. Finally we test our our model and make the forecast.
